# Fulhaus
Technical Assessment for Janis Zaldin

This project consists of two components: a Frontend, and a Backend.  

The Frontend portion contains a minimal shopping app built using React. 


The Backend portion makes four API calls to a database, and can be tested using Postman, or a similar program:

Get
Post
Patch
Delete

It was built using Node, Express and Mongoose.  It is expecting environment variables to be set for the PORT, as well as the DATABASE_URI (string conneciton for a MongoDB database)

connection string for my example database:

mongodb+srv://GodsCoffeePorter:CaffeineForAll@cluster0.lpoaz.mongodb.net/Fulhaus?retryWrites=true&w=majority
